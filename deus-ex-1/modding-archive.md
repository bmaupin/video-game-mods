## Misc

#### Create XXD patch

â“˜ Since plain text files are easier to work with, this method uses plain text patch files, which is possible because we're working with small files and the length of the files isn't being changed.

- Create a patch file manually

  Patch files are pretty straightforward, each line has an address, byte, and optional comment, e.g.

  ```
  0047b087: ed # BumFemale BumFemaleTex1 -> JunkieMaleTex1
  0047b088: 12
  ```

- Or, edit the file with a hex editor and create the patch file using `xxd`:

  1.  Edit the file with a hex editor

      1. Open DeusEx.u with a hex editor

         ```
         ghex ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Deus\ Ex/System/DeusEx.u
         ```

      1. Go to the byte offset

         e.g. for ghex use _Edit_ > _Goto Byte_

      1. Make sure the value of the property matches what you found earlier

      1. Replace the value of the old texture with the value of the new texture

         In ghex, you can type directly into the main window to edit the file

         e.g. replace E4 12 at 0x000525c6 with D9 0C

      1. Save the file

  1.  Generate the patch

      ```
      comm -13 <(xxd -c1 DeusEx.u.bak) <(xxd -c1 DeusEx.u) > DeusEx.u.patch
      ```

      - `xxd -c1` dumps the files into hexadecimal text values, one byte per line
      - `comm -13` shows only the lines in the second file that differ from the first file

To apply the patch:

```
xxd -c1 -r DeusEx.u.patch ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Deus\ Ex/System/DeusEx.u
```

#### Editing textures

1. Open UTPT

1. Change export location

1. Export texture as BMP

   - Just export the first texture

1. Open texture with GIMP

1. Select hands

1. Invert selection

1. _Colors_ > _Colorize_

1. Turn down _Saturation_ all the way

1. Turn down _Lightness_ as far as desired

1. _Colors_ > _Brightness-Contrast_ > turn Brightness all the way down > _OK_

1. Repeat last step as many times as desired

#### Install SDK

1. Get SDK
